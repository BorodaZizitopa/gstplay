gstplay is a fast basic media player using GStreamer and GTK+. It can be
compiled with any combination of GStreamer (0.10.18+ or 1.0) and GTK+
(2.x or 3.x) versions. GStreamer 1.0 is recommended as it is faster and
is the version primarily used during development.

The goal of gstplay is to provide minimal overhead and fast playback on
lower-end systems, using hardware acceleration (such as xvimagesink and
accelerated libav plugins) where available. To achieve this it does not
use a double-buffered window and supports viewing files with all audio
decoding disabled. It has been developed on an ARM platform.

The program also supports console mode with a user-definable video sink
outputting to (for example) the Linux framebuffer console. See the
section on console usage.

This is an early development release that has not yet been tested on a
wide variety of media formats (only with mp4-type files on disk). Things
like playlists and sliders and not (yet) supported.

*** Requirements ***

The GStreamer and GTK+-specific development headers and libraries need
to be installed. On a Debian-based Linux system, this includes the
following packages:

libglib2.0-dev
libgstreamer0.10-dev (when compiling for GStreamer 0.10)
libgstreamer1.0-dev (when compiling for GStreamer 1.0)
libgtk2.0-dev (when compiling for GTK+ 2)
libgtk-3-dev (when compiling for GTK+ 3)

You may also need any of the following packages for GStreamer 0.10 and
1.0 respectively:

libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev
gstreamer0.10-plugins-good
gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad
gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly

libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev
gstreamer1.0-plugins-good
gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad
gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly

*** Building ***

Edit the Makefile to set GTK_MAJOR_VERSION to 2 or 3, and GST_VERSION
to 1.0 or 0.10. GStreamer 1.0 is recommended (faster).

Running "make" should work.

*** Running ***

Run with --options for command line options. However, gstplay also has an
interactive mode with configurable settings.

*** Running in console mode ***

When X is not detected, gstplay will run in console mode with media specified
on the command line. The video sink can be configured with the --videosink
option; it is possible to pass property settings to the video sink, for example
using bash:

	gstplay --videosink '"fbdev2sink native-resolution-true"' video.mp4

Note the use of double quotes inside single quotes (the single quotes cause the
videosink argument to be parsed as one argument, while the double quotes are
necessary for GStreamer to parse the videosink properties correctly).

It is also possible enable console mode from an X terminal with the --nogui option.

*** Issues ***

- When using the xvimagesink the video area is not properly updated after
  an occluding window is removed. This seems to be specific to the sunxi platform.

- When going fullscreen with GTK+ 3 an ugly transition with a white area is
  visible (should at least be black).

- Using gstreamer 1.0 it possible to use a more elegant way to hook the window ID
  than the current method.

- At the moment when a media file is specified on the command line in GUI
  mode gstplay will do a test pipeline run to determine the video size
  before opening a window. This shouldn't be necessary.

- Configuration cannot be saved yet.

- Error handling could use improvment.

- Passing suitable default or configured options to console sinks like
  fbdev2sink should be possible.
